          # NOTE The main purpose of this service is the multiplex the usb microphone
          # so I use a liveness probe to tie the health of this service to whether a
          # usb microphone is available.
          #
          # NOTE I am *not* using a readiness probe because I haven't found a way to
          # get kuberetes to "hand off" ownership of the mic when updating the service.
          # Basically, Kubernetes uses a readiness probe to decide when a Pod is ready
          # to receive traffic. During an update it does a swicth:
          #
          #       /[A]
          #  [svc]
          #        [B waiting for readiness probe...]
          #
          #        [A terminating...]
          #  [svc]
          #       \[B ready!]
          #
          # Unfortunately, if "A" is kept alive in this case, it holds onto the mic causing
          # it to appear busy. This may not be a big deal, but I just wanted to document how
          # what's usually the right behavior affects this service a little differently.
